Palette Paintbox Privacy Policy

The purpose of the Palette Paintbox app is to gather and store data about user-created color palettes.

No data from user input is stored on any remote server. All data is stored in a SQLite database that is local to the device.

This database stores data about the colors in a palette as well as the name given to the palette. User preferences including theme and display of color code formats are also stored.

To delete a palette, use the built-in delete function. All data pertaining to the specified palette including colors and its name will be permanently deleted from the device.

Currently, there is no functionality for sharing color palettes or other data between users of the app.
