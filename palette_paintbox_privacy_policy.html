Palette Paintbox Privacy Policy
<br />
The purpose of the Palette Paintbox app is to gather and store data about user-created color palettes.

This database stores data about the colors in a palette as well as the name given to the palette. User preferences including theme and display of color code formats are also stored.
<br />
To delete a palette, use the built-in delete function. All data pertaining to the specified palette including colors and its name will be permanently deleted from the device.
<br />
Currently, there is no functionality for sharing color palettes or other data between users of the app.
